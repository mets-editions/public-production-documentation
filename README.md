# public-production-documentation
This repository contains all workflow documentation followed by METS staff. There are three major strands of workflow: Print Production, InDesign Production, and Digital Production.

- All files starting with "Print-" are part of the Print Production workflow. We follow this workflow to create the print edition published by Medieval Institute Publications. Current versions: 10/31/2024
  
- All files starting with "InDesign-" are part of the InDesign Production workflow, which takes place at the end of Print Production. We use Adobe InDesign as our publication software to format and typeset our editions. We use our InDesign files as the basis for both our print and digital editions, and so the Paragraph and Character styles we created are designed to both format the edition visually as well as mark up information that is important for our digital edition. Current versions: 10/31/2024

- All files starting with "Digital-" are part of the Digital Production workflow. We follow this workflow to convert our print edition files into the TEI-XML files that form our digital editions. Current versions: 10/31/2024

- METS File Naming Conventions: This document explains in detail the file naming conventions we use in house for both print and digital production. Current version: 10/31/2024

- METS File Naming Dictionary: This document defines specific terms referenced in the METS File Naming Conventions document. Current version: 10/31/2024
